# The NoterTaker

## Task

`To modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.`

With no frontend code needed to be edited, I have built backend code to serve functionality as required. I have also included the Delete function as required.

## Usage

Head to (the Heroku app)[https://the-notertaker.herokuapp.com] and enjoy!
